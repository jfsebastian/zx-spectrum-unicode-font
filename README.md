# zx-spectrum-unicode-font #
Project to Open/Crowd Source a complete well build font based on the ZX Spectrum original system font.

The whole project is based on the wonderful job made by Darko Stanicic with his Spectrum True Type Font, still available (for example) in [World of Spectrum](http://www.worldofspectrum.org/utilities.html), and released as healthware.

The idea of improve and complete this font comes from a personal project I started a few years ago (and the willing to learn). I realized that some of the glyphs' shape was reversed and had been drawn with intersections which seems to be problematic sometimes. So my objective is to redraw it with no intersections, add some more unicode characters, and let the people to complete and improve the work if they find it interesting.

## Tools ##

I'm not an expert in fonts and obviously not a designer. I hope that the font is simple enough to be able to understand the glyph/font processes.

As I'm and open source enthusiast I'll work mainly with [FontForge](https://fontforge.github.io) both GUI and Python library.
