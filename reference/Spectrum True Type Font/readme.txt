ZX Spectrum True Type Font, Regular and Bold (International)
Version 1.1
Created by Darko Stanicic, darone@sezampro.yu

What's New?
- Bold style!
- Euro sign added.
- Regular style updated, a few corrected characters, a lot of minor
point adjustments.
- TTFs are half the size of the previous version.
- Still released as healthware.

The Font
This font's based on the Sinclair ZX Spectrum ROM character set and
its 8x8 grid.

Legal Stuff
It is released as healthware, which means that if you use it, you will
live through a happy and joyful life. No money, no email, no
postcards, no fuss at all. You can do whatever you want with the font.

Bold
As I've mentioned in the readme.txt for the original version, when I
finished the font there were no bold or italic (nor bold-italic)
versions. I was thinking of making at least the bold version, so here
it is! Some games use this bold version, it's pretty easy to make,
something like ROR and OR A, and I hope some of you will remember.

Making of the bold version was nothing compared to the time and effort
put into the original - back than I had to design more than 400
characters.

Italic
Now, for the italic... maybe in a few years, who knows?

The Characters
It supports several Unicode ranges:

Basic Latin
Latin-1 Supplement
Latin Extended-A
Basic Greek
Cyrillic

and more than a few Code Pages:

1252 Latin 1
1250 Latin 2: East Europe
1251 Cyrillic
1253 Greek
1254 Turkish
1257 Windows Baltic
Windows OEM Character Set
869 IBM Greek
866 MS-DOS Russian
865 MS-DOS Nordic
863 MS-DOS Canadian French
861 MS-DOS Icelandic
860 MS-DOS Portuguese
857 MS-DOS IBM Turkish
855 IBM Cyrillic; Primarily Russian
852 Latin 2
775 MS-DOS Baltic
737 Greek; former 437 G
850 WE/Latin 1
437 US

There are 653 glyphs in it, even ff, fl, ffi and ffl ligatures (not
very useful, but I had to do them) - everything I found around, and it
is nowhere near kern. You can see all of the glyphs in two accompanied
GIFs.

If you notice some of the international letters badly represented,
some pixel missed or added or even a whole character wrong, please
email me.

Usage (International)
If the application you're using is Unicode compliant (Microsoft Office
97 and newer, Adobe InDesign, etc.), just install the font and off you
go. If it isn't, you should add following lines (or just the one you
need) in [FontSubstitutes] section of the win.ini system file:

ZX Spectrum Greek,161=ZX Spectrum,161
ZX Spectrum Tur,162=ZX Spectrum,162
ZX Spectrum Baltic,186=ZX Spectrum,186
ZX Spectrum Cyr,204=ZX Spectrum,204
ZX Spectrum CE,238=ZX Spectrum,238

When you restart your system, five new fonts will appear with Greek,
Turkish, Baltic, Cyrillic and Central European characters. Of course,
you should install keyboard layouts for desired languages.

Thank You Thank You Thank You
I'd like to thank Bojan Stojanovic for some essential info on how to
set up Fontographer. Also, a big thanks goes to Dragan Petrovic for
digging my Spectrum cassetes out of dust. I'd also like to thank Sir
Clive Sinclair for creating the best computer ever (at least in my
heart). Finally, thank you, Emigre, for inspiring my life and sending
me free posters.
